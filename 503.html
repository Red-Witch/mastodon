<h1> RIP LMAO THE MAINT WAS EXTENDED ANOTHER <strike>HALF HOUR</strike> FOURTY FIVE MINUTES </h1>
<p>this is a low tech blog now how y'all doin</p>
<p>i ate a sandwich today</p>
<p>not really but that seems like pretty generic e/n content lol</p>
<p>actually i had a mcdouble i guess thats a sandwich</p>
<p>anyway, that doesn't matter. what does matter is, runes</p>
<p>5 minutes until wasabi is up lol. actually probably they will extend it again lmao</p>
<p>twitter is removing favs i guess, we're ahead of the curve at witches.live now we are removing features like "posting" and "media"</p>
<p>pop tarts are a sandwich</p>
<p>vile things pop tarts are. they're so tempting due to being full of a shitton of sugar, but the problem is they are full of a shitton of sugar. i guess what im saying is nationalize kellogs or whomever makes those piles of trash and then stop making garbage like that</p>
<p>sorry if that was annoying, im just really tempted by pop tarts a lot</p>
<p>mail in your reciept with six proofs of purchase for a chance to get one star wars battle front two loot box card (guaranteed dupes)</p>
<p>todd is a noob</p>
<p>well the appointed time is nigh, but its not up immediately. i demand satisfaction</p>
<p>did you know: white "people" only know one magic spell and its how to summon managers</p>
<p>im not using &amp;quot; to do my quotes. they are raw quotes. i live dangerously.</p>
<p>wasabi continues to be down with no updates on their twitter, really. hecked up.</p>
<p>lmao ripppp they just extended the time another 15 minutes</p>
<p>my housemate is watching boku no hero acadamea. it seems really anime.</p>
<p>its not "my hero academa" you FUCKING PHILISTINES</p>
<p>fuckit we're bringing witches back up what could go wrong (also i blame razgriz if something goes wrong)</p>
